battlevoice_chr000_100,"Hyde: C'mon out, Insulator!"
battlevoice_chr000_101,Hyde: If you're gonna get in my way... I'll just mop you up!
battlevoice_chr000_102,Hyde: ...My power'll finish the job!
battlevoice_chr000_103,Hyde: Lemme show you... my power!
battlevoice_chr000_108,"Hyde: I'm not gonna be the same old Hyde forever, y'know."
battlevoice_chr000_111,Hyde: Sure have. And I've got you to thank for it.
battlevoice_chr000_113,Hyde: H-Hey! Don't say stuff that people might get twisted!
battlevoice_chr000_115,"Hyde: Welp, I guess we gotta settle things, anyway."
battlevoice_chr000_118,Hyde: Yet another bastard who never learns...
battlevoice_chr000_121,Hyde: What can I say? I'm a rebel. Nothing personal.
battlevoice_chr000_124,"Hyde: All right, time to drop the curtain!"
battlevoice_chr000_127,"Hyde: Tch. Can't believe I'm stuck with you, apparently."
battlevoice_chr000_130,"Hyde: ...Can't you just play nice and back down, already?"
battlevoice_chr000_133,Hyde: I didn't wanna fight you.
battlevoice_chr000_136,Hyde: You just might be the hardest one to deal with of all...
battlevoice_chr000_138,Hyde: Yeesh. Y'know what the scariest thing about you is? You almost look human.
battlevoice_chr000_151,Hyde: The wind's... pretty rough...
battlevoice_chr000_152,"Hyde: What...? All show and no substance, huh?"
battlevoice_chr000_155,Hyde: Just take a nap there.
battlevoice_chr000_156,Hyde: I guess this means I've grown.
battlevoice_chr000_157,Hyde: This is... my power...
battlevoice_chr000_160,Hyde: Th-That was a close one...
battlevoice_chr000_164,Hyde: Y'know... That wasn't as big a deal as I thought.
battlevoice_chr000_169,Hyde: See how I've grown? Leave the rest to me.
battlevoice_chr000_171,"Hyde: Sorry, Harada! I'll make it up to you sometime!"
battlevoice_chr001_100,Linne: Here comes trouble.
battlevoice_chr001_101,Linne: It looks like I've bumped into a real bother.
battlevoice_chr001_108,Linne: Obviously. You don't have to tell me that.
battlevoice_chr001_111,"Linne: Ah, when you live long enough, you start to forget things."
battlevoice_chr001_114,Linne: Not to worry. It'll all be over soon.
battlevoice_chr001_117,Linne: It's been a while since I had a serious fight.
battlevoice_chr001_120,"Linne: Not the way you are now, you won't."
battlevoice_chr001_131,Linne: Are you awake yet?
battlevoice_chr001_132,Linne: What? It's nothing to get discouraged about.
battlevoice_chr001_136,Linne: Are you even trying?
battlevoice_chr001_139,Linne: Well done. That's all I'll say.
battlevoice_chr001_140,Linne: Hmph. Too slow.
battlevoice_chr001_143,Linne: Not bad. That was actually entertaining.
battlevoice_chr001_146,Linne: Worse than bad... Unremarkable.
battlevoice_chr001_150,Linne: You've come a long way. But leave the rest to me.
battlevoice_chr001_153,Linne: Enough games. Rest now.
battlevoice_chr001_156,Linne: My long journey... comes to an end here.
battlevoice_chr002_100,Waldstein: Gwoooh! Break! Smash!
battlevoice_chr002_103,Waldstein: Prepare yourself... Uooohhh!
battlevoice_chr002_109,Waldstein: Hmm. Looks like you've grown a bit.
battlevoice_chr002_112,Waldstein: What can you cut with those slender arms?
battlevoice_chr002_115,Waldstein: Hmph. At least this might be a little enjoyable...
battlevoice_chr002_118,Waldstein: I'll have you accept my fists!
battlevoice_chr002_122,Waldstein: Let's allow the immense powers we've kept hidden to do the talking.
battlevoice_chr002_131,Waldstein: Stand up!
battlevoice_chr002_132,Waldstein: Do you understand the difference in our strength now?
battlevoice_chr002_135,Waldstein: ...I'm surprised you survived for this long.
battlevoice_chr002_136,Waldstein: There's nothing my claws can't rend!
battlevoice_chr002_139,"Waldstein: Heh. That was an exciting, heated battle."
battlevoice_chr002_142,Waldstein: Hmph. Boring.
battlevoice_chr002_147,"Waldstein: Not quite, boy."
battlevoice_chr002_149,"Waldstein: Not quite, girl."
battlevoice_chr002_151,"Waldstein: Not quite, inhuman one."
battlevoice_chr002_153,Waldstein: Heh... You're still green.
battlevoice_chr003_100,Carmine: Keh heh heh... It's too late for remorse now?
battlevoice_chr003_101,Carmine: You weaklings should keep your damn distance...
battlevoice_chr003_102,Carmine: I'm just gonna twist ya up a little.
battlevoice_chr003_107,"Carmine: Gotta have a hobby, right? Stay outta this."
battlevoice_chr003_110,Carmine: Keh... Worry 'bout your own damn life.
battlevoice_chr003_113,"Carmine: Don't get cocky, kid..."
battlevoice_chr003_122,Carmine: Keh heh heh heh heh... Haaa ha ha ha ha haah!
battlevoice_chr003_124,Carmine: C'mon! Try a little harder!
battlevoice_chr003_127,Carmine: That's not even close to enough!
battlevoice_chr003_128,Carmine: Now you know your place!
battlevoice_chr003_131,Carmine: Bastard... A dog like you should know better than to bite me!
battlevoice_chr003_134,Carmine: Tch... You can't even stave off my boredom.
battlevoice_chr003_138,"Carmine: I dunno what your deal is, but you're pissing me off..."
battlevoice_chr003_141,Carmine: Stupid kid... Go play house with your big sister.
battlevoice_chr004_100,"Orie: In the name of justice, I'll save you."
battlevoice_chr004_102,Orie: I'll have you withdraw from here.
battlevoice_chr004_103,Orie: I swing the hammer of light in accordance with the law.
battlevoice_chr004_108,"Orie: Indeed, though I admit I'm a bit reluctant."
battlevoice_chr004_110,Orie: Begone at once... or else.
battlevoice_chr004_111,Orie: Is this also fate at work?
battlevoice_chr004_113,"Orie: No more than you can, no."
battlevoice_chr004_115,Orie: Submit yourself to scrutiny.
battlevoice_chr004_117,"Orie: Those feelings are enough, Mika."
battlevoice_chr004_120,"Orie: I shall vanquish those desires within you, here and now."
battlevoice_chr004_122,Orie: I'll stop you in the name of Licht Kreis!
battlevoice_chr004_124,Orie: I cannot depend on you forever.
battlevoice_chr004_140,Orie: Stand up! This isn't finished yet!
battlevoice_chr004_141,Orie: The outcome is settled.
battlevoice_chr004_150,Orie: This was for the best... wasn't it?
battlevoice_chr004_151,Orie: Was there a meaning to this fight?
battlevoice_chr004_154,Orie: That was much too close...
battlevoice_chr004_158,Orie: Now you see the difference in the burdens we bear...
battlevoice_chr004_164,Orie: I shall fulfill my duty...
battlevoice_chr004_165,"Orie: I'm sorry, Kido..."
battlevoice_chr004_167,"Orie: I'm sorry, Erika. Leave the rest to me."
battlevoice_chr004_170,Orie: Was this... really for the best?
battlevoice_chr004_172,Orie: This one makes bedfellows with death!
battlevoice_chr005_100,Gordeau: Such turbulent wind...
battlevoice_chr005_101,Gordeau: So you finally showed up?
battlevoice_chr005_102,Gordeau: Let's get this over with.
battlevoice_chr005_103,Gordeau: This should be fun.
battlevoice_chr005_108,"Gordeau: So you came out yourself, huh? That's rare."
battlevoice_chr005_111,Gordeau: You look pale. Are you feeling okay?
battlevoice_chr005_114,"Gordeau: Watch your step. Go too far, and you might get hurt."
battlevoice_chr005_117,Gordeau: Found anyone who measures up yet?
battlevoice_chr005_120,"Gordeau: So we finally meet, Flame Tyrant."
battlevoice_chr005_121,Gordeau: Give me just a little of your time.
battlevoice_chr005_123,"Gordeau: I know this won't change anything, but..."
battlevoice_chr005_132,Gordeau: What a pushover.
battlevoice_chr005_133,Gordeau: We've both got bad luck.
battlevoice_chr005_138,Gordeau: Looks like your senses have dulled quite a bit.
battlevoice_chr005_139,"Gordeau: Whoa, there. I'm not happy with a win if you're holding back."
battlevoice_chr005_142,Gordeau: C'mon. Stand up.
battlevoice_chr005_143,Gordeau: This is the famous Flame Tyrant?
battlevoice_chr005_147,Gordeau: You faced the wrong guy.
battlevoice_chr005_148,"Gordeau: Your skills weren't too bad, either."
battlevoice_chr005_152,Gordeau: See? This is why the Night's so scary.
battlevoice_chr005_155,"Gordeau: There's such a thing as too strong, y'know..."
battlevoice_chr005_160,"Gordeau: Geez, you're a piece of work, you know that?"
battlevoice_chr005_162,"Gordeau: You don't disappoint, my friend. Or are you my greatest nemesis? Either way, I'm impressed."
battlevoice_chr005_163,Gordeau: This is fun. See? This is exactly why I can't stop fighting you.
battlevoice_chr005_166,Gordeau: What a letdown...
battlevoice_chr005_167,Gordeau: This changes... nothing.
battlevoice_chr006_100,Merkava: Gyo gyo goooh!
battlevoice_chr006_101,Merkava: Gyuoooh!
battlevoice_chr006_102,Merkava: Let me have a good taste of you.
battlevoice_chr006_103,Merkava: Kwehhh!
battlevoice_chr006_104,Merkava: Kwoooaaahhh!
battlevoice_chr006_109,"Merkava: That is the very definition of hubris, girl..."
battlevoice_chr006_112,"Merkava: Oh, such a thing never even existed."
battlevoice_chr006_115,Merkava: I shall be the one to devour this world!
battlevoice_chr006_125,Merkava: Kyuraaahhh!
battlevoice_chr006_126,Merkava: Keeeoooooohhh!
battlevoice_chr006_127,Merkava: I cannot contain my excitement!
battlevoice_chr006_130,"Merkava: Gwah... Gaaah, gaah! Gaaahhh, gaaahhh!"
battlevoice_chr006_131,"Merkava: I savored that, little human."
battlevoice_chr006_134,Merkava: Thank you for the entertainment.
battlevoice_chr006_138,Merkava: How trifling.
battlevoice_chr006_143,Merkava: I gratefully accept your soul to augment my own power.
battlevoice_chr006_145,Merkava: I shall swallow you along with this world...
battlevoice_chr007_100,Vatista: Commencing ability evaluation.
battlevoice_chr007_101,Vatista: Switching to obliteration task.
battlevoice_chr007_102,Vatista: Commencing cleanup operations.
battlevoice_chr007_105,Vatista: I'll defeat you and move on. That's my will.
battlevoice_chr007_107,Vatista: Fate turns in its cycle. Now we stand opposed.
battlevoice_chr007_114,Vatista: Assigned task complete. Resistance insignificant.
battlevoice_chr007_116,Vatista: Decreasing subject's evaluation score.
battlevoice_chr007_118,Vatista: *yawn* Sleepy.
battlevoice_chr007_119,Vatista: Assigned task complete. Switching to normal mode.
battlevoice_chr007_121,Vatista: Cleanup task complete. Damage insignificant.
battlevoice_chr007_123,Vatista: *yawn* Nnnh...
battlevoice_chr007_127,"Vatista: Combat effectiveness evaluated. As expected, it would be too dangerous to allow subject to proceed."
battlevoice_chr008_100,"Seth: If you value your life, stay out of my way."
battlevoice_chr008_101,Seth: Resistance is useless.
battlevoice_chr008_102,Seth: Cut the advertisement. Get ready.
battlevoice_chr008_107,Seth: You're nothing... Hmph!
battlevoice_chr008_109,Seth: I think it's clear there's no need...
battlevoice_chr008_112,"Seth: We talked about this. I'm the one who's supposed to go, remember?"
battlevoice_chr008_115,"Seth: The chains that bind me, for starters..."
battlevoice_chr008_118,Seth: Heh. Like I had any left in the first place.
battlevoice_chr008_121,Seth: Heh. A shattered plate can never be put back together.
battlevoice_chr008_124,"Seth: I've been waiting for this moment, Aeon!"
battlevoice_chr008_133,Seth: Finished already?
battlevoice_chr008_134,Seth: How anticlimactic.
battlevoice_chr008_135,Seth: ...Your doubts dull your judgment.
battlevoice_chr008_140,Seth: That's what all your big talk was about?
battlevoice_chr008_141,Seth: Stand up. You think this ends with just words?
battlevoice_chr008_144,Seth: This is the difference in the burdens we bear.
battlevoice_chr008_145,Seth: The Night and its causality... I'll put an end to it all.
battlevoice_chr008_148,Seth: This is indulgence. All things come to an end.
battlevoice_chr008_151,Seth: Know that resistance is pointless.
battlevoice_chr008_156,Seth: Sleep there until this is all over.
battlevoice_chr008_158,Seth: No need to fight anymore. I'll settle everything...
battlevoice_chr008_160,"Seth: Sleep now. I'll carry your sins with me, too."
battlevoice_chr009_100,Yuzuriha: Awriiight! Get ready!
battlevoice_chr009_101,Yuzuriha: Here's a challenge... Please accept!
battlevoice_chr009_102,"Yuzuriha: Sheesh... You're not gonna let me win easily, are you?"
battlevoice_chr009_103,"Yuzuriha: I like that look in your eyes... C'mon, let's go!"
battlevoice_chr009_104,Yuzuriha: I've already thrown away all doubt.
battlevoice_chr009_108,Yuzuriha: Looks like your doubts are gone.
battlevoice_chr009_110,Yuzuriha: Very well! I accept your challenge!
battlevoice_chr009_112,"Yuzuriha: Power and defense, huh? This is gonna be a tough one."
battlevoice_chr009_114,Yuzuriha: That's why I'm gonna change things up! Your fate included!
battlevoice_chr009_122,Yuzuriha: Easy win!
battlevoice_chr009_123,Yuzuriha: And thus! Darkness was vanquished!
battlevoice_chr009_124,Yuzuriha: Awright! Doing great!
battlevoice_chr009_125,"Yuzuriha: Welp, that about does it!"
battlevoice_chr009_126,"Yuzuriha: Know your role! Ha ha, just kidding!"
battlevoice_chr009_129,Yuzuriha: Heeey! You still alive?
battlevoice_chr009_130,"Yuzuriha: Learn your lesson and give up, okay?"
battlevoice_chr009_133,Yuzuriha: I'd say you tried harder than most.
battlevoice_chr009_136,Yuzuriha: I-I wonder if I overdid it...
battlevoice_chr009_140,"Yuzuriha: Look at you, growing so much! I love to see it!"
battlevoice_chr009_142,Yuzuriha: Just leave everything else to me!
battlevoice_chr010_100,"Hilda: Hee hee hee... Make this fun for me, won't you?"
battlevoice_chr010_101,Hilda: Sing my praises! Let me hear you!
battlevoice_chr010_102,Hilda: Hmm... I suppose I can spare some time to play with you.
battlevoice_chr010_110,"Hilda: So cheeky. You're making light of me, aren't you?"
battlevoice_chr010_111,Hilda: I hope you're prepared to be thoroughly trounced.
battlevoice_chr010_112,"Hilda: I'll defeat you, and then all the rest, by myself."
battlevoice_chr010_113,"Hilda: Let's settle this, shall we?"
battlevoice_chr010_114,Hilda: You must have been dreadfully bored until now.
battlevoice_chr010_115,Hilda: Do you have any idea how long it took me to get here?
battlevoice_chr010_116,Hilda: How kind of fate to include your crushing defeat.
battlevoice_chr010_130,Hilda: Hee hee... I've got nothing to say to a weakling like you.
battlevoice_chr010_131,Hilda: This is what we call power. Overwhelming power.
battlevoice_chr010_140,"Hilda: Splendid, Chaos. Maybe I misjudged you."
battlevoice_chr010_150,Hilda: ...Heh heh heh... Ahh ha ha ha ha haaa!
battlevoice_chr010_151,Hilda: Hee hee... How very wretched...
battlevoice_chr010_155,"Hilda: I was holding back, you know. I wonder if you noticed."
battlevoice_chr010_158,"Hilda: Oh, dear. How weak."
battlevoice_chr010_160,Hilda: Keep your mouth shut and come along with me.
battlevoice_chr010_161,Hilda: Ahh ha ha ha haaa! I feel amazing!
battlevoice_chr010_162,Hilda: Looks like rebirth isn't all it's cracked up to be.
battlevoice_chr011_100,Eltnum: Time for your punishment.
battlevoice_chr011_101,Eltnum: I'll show you what a difference experience can make.
battlevoice_chr011_106,"Eltnum: Shall we have one last dance, senpai?"
battlevoice_chr011_115,"Eltnum: You ought to look up the word ""reckless"" sometime."
battlevoice_chr011_116,Eltnum: These numbers are below the estimates... How shameful.
battlevoice_chr011_117,Eltnum: Hmph. How wretched...
battlevoice_chr011_120,Eltnum: And we're finished! No surprises there.
battlevoice_chr011_121,Eltnum: Have you learned your lesson?
battlevoice_chr011_124,"Eltnum: You surpassed my calculations... Impressive, but it doesn't change the results."
battlevoice_chr011_127,Eltnum: That was a simple problem.
battlevoice_chr011_132,Eltnum: I'm grateful for this chance!
battlevoice_chr012_100,Nanase: I can feel it in the wind... You're eager to fight!
battlevoice_chr012_101,Nanase: I'll show you my strength!
battlevoice_chr012_106,"Nanase: I found you... Prepare yourself, Hyde Kido!"
battlevoice_chr012_108,Nanase: Oh! Senpai!
battlevoice_chr012_117,Nanase: All right!
battlevoice_chr012_118,Nanase: I did it!
battlevoice_chr012_121,"Nanase: Oh, I gotta report this, ASAP! Um, hello? Yeah, it's me..."
battlevoice_chr012_122,Nanase: Now's my chance!
battlevoice_chr012_123,"Nanase: Here I am, in the Hollow Night! Aaand... send!"
battlevoice_chr012_126,"Nanase: Oh, I gotta take notes on that last attack!"
battlevoice_chr012_129,Nanase: Hashtag winning! Aaand... send!
battlevoice_chr012_134,"Nanase: I did it! Now prepare yourself, Hyde Kido!"
battlevoice_chr012_136,"Nanase: All right, I took down a senpai! This whole act is getting kinda old, though..."
battlevoice_chr013_080,"Tsukuyomi: I leave the rest to you, Byakuya."
battlevoice_chr013_081,Tsukuyomi: We can't get rid of this guy...
battlevoice_chr013_082,Tsukuyomi: We can't get rid of this girl...
battlevoice_chr013_083,Tsukuyomi: My little brother Byakuya has come to devour you.
battlevoice_chr013_101,"Byakuya: You can count on me, Sis."
battlevoice_chr013_104,Byakuya: Ah. Good evening.
battlevoice_chr013_105,"Byakuya: Sorry to rush this along, but you need to disappear."
battlevoice_chr013_106,Byakuya: You really are pushy.
battlevoice_chr013_107,"Byakuya: Well, well. We meet again."
battlevoice_chr013_109,Byakuya: Would you stop picking fights under my name?
battlevoice_chr013_118,Byakuya: I'll wipe that smile off your face.
battlevoice_chr013_120,Byakuya: Stop copying me.
battlevoice_chr013_129,"Byakuya: Hey, are you still alive?"
battlevoice_chr013_130,"Byakuya: You're not actually finished yet, are you?"
battlevoice_chr013_131,Byakuya: How weak.
battlevoice_chr013_132,Byakuya: Get it now? Your resistance was pointless.
battlevoice_chr013_135,Byakuya: You really are all talk.
battlevoice_chr013_136,Byakuya: Huh? Finished already?
battlevoice_chr013_137,Byakuya: You're not even worth eating.
battlevoice_chr013_138,Byakuya: Huh? You really are weak.
battlevoice_chr013_140,Byakuya: Aha ha ha! What a weakling.
battlevoice_chr013_141,Byakuya: Aha ha ha ha!
battlevoice_chr013_146,"Byakuya: You gave it your best shot, I guess. But it's over now."
battlevoice_chr013_149,Byakuya: What? That's all?
battlevoice_chr014_100,Akatsuki: I could survive even death itself!
battlevoice_chr014_101,Akatsuki: Send me all your slings and arrows!
battlevoice_chr014_102,Akatsuki: Is there no end to my misfortune?
battlevoice_chr014_106,Akatsuki: You're as strange as ever.
battlevoice_chr014_114,Akatsuki: Sei!
battlevoice_chr014_115,Akatsuki: How pitiful. Stand up!
battlevoice_chr014_116,Akatsuki: Finished already?!
battlevoice_chr014_119,Akatsuki: I am the god of thunder! I am invincible!
battlevoice_chr014_120,"Akatsuki: Even if my body dies, I'll fiercely defend the nation in spirit!"
battlevoice_chr014_123,Akatsuki: You put up an impressively ferocious fight...
battlevoice_chr014_126,Akatsuki: You lack training!
battlevoice_chr014_130,"Akatsuki: Farewell, my so-called junior. Keep your quarrels in moderation."
battlevoice_chr014_131,"Akatsuki: Ours is a strange bond... We may meet again, if we both survive."
battlevoice_chr015_100,Chaos: It looks like I'm on cleanup duty.
battlevoice_chr015_101,Chaos: I usually stick to more cerebral tasks...
battlevoice_chr015_102,Chaos: How long do you plan to flail about?
battlevoice_chr015_103,Chaos: Do go easy on me.
battlevoice_chr015_104,"Chaos: Just don't break my glasses, okay?"
battlevoice_chr015_108,Chaos: You were on my mind. What other reason is there?
battlevoice_chr015_110,Chaos: Hilda... You again...?
battlevoice_chr015_111,"Chaos: Well, at least I was prepared to run into you."
battlevoice_chr015_113,Chaos: Last chance. Want to join forces with us again?
battlevoice_chr015_115,"Chaos: If I win... you know what happens, right?"
battlevoice_chr015_117,"Chaos: The feeling's mutual. I don't mind you, either."
battlevoice_chr015_125,Chaos: You're more capable than I expected.
battlevoice_chr015_126,"Chaos: A sensible, intelligent victory."
battlevoice_chr015_127,"Chaos: ...You held back, didn't you, Gordeau?"
battlevoice_chr015_128,"Chaos: You never change, either."
battlevoice_chr015_130,Chaos: Sorry. Azhi Dahaka's manners need some work.
battlevoice_chr015_131,Chaos: I'd say that was a good bout.
battlevoice_chr015_132,Chaos: I'd hoped for a smarter victory.
battlevoice_chr015_133,Chaos: I sense no intelligence in your fighting style.
battlevoice_chr015_134,"Chaos: Fighting you is fun and all, but alas, one only lives once."
battlevoice_chr015_135,Chaos: Th-that was ridiculous... Are you trying to kill me?
battlevoice_chr015_136,Chaos: Nearly losing one's life in a test of skill is taking things too far...
battlevoice_chr015_137,"Chaos: Yes, you really are fascinating. Just as I thought."
battlevoice_chr016_100,"Wagner: Curse your misfortune, that you ran into me."
battlevoice_chr016_101,Wagner: I'll finish you in mere moments.
battlevoice_chr016_102,Wagner: Will you put my flame to the test?
battlevoice_chr016_103,Wagner: I'll show you how EXS should be used.
battlevoice_chr016_104,Wagner: So here we are. Your luck must be as bad as mine.
battlevoice_chr016_109,"Wagner: Time to settle our old score. Let's go, honor student."
battlevoice_chr016_112,Wagner: It seems we've got our chance without a need for schemes. Shall we?
battlevoice_chr016_115,Wagner: Very well. Give me everything you've got.
battlevoice_chr016_117,Wagner: Bold of you to show yourself before the Void Hunter.
battlevoice_chr016_119,Wagner: Heh. It looks like you just can't forget me.
battlevoice_chr016_123,"Wagner: I ask for a bout, samurai."
battlevoice_chr016_126,"Wagner: Cut the tedious talk. If you're going to fight, fight."
battlevoice_chr016_135,Wagner: Stand up. I'll burn you to ash next.
battlevoice_chr016_136,Wagner: Is that all you can seriously muster?
battlevoice_chr016_137,Wagner: Face me as many times as you like. The result will be the same.
battlevoice_chr016_143,"Wagner: What's wrong, honor student? Finished already?"
battlevoice_chr016_145,Wagner: Satisfied yet? I'll send you after your friends right away.
battlevoice_chr016_148,Wagner: Does that make the difference in our capabilities clear enough for you?
battlevoice_chr016_149,Wagner: Yet another one who fails to deliver.
battlevoice_chr016_150,Wagner: All this disciplining is starting to get tedious.
battlevoice_chr016_151,Wagner: You're too weak. Just like everyone else around here.
battlevoice_chr016_154,Wagner: Any who stand against me will burn. That's all.
battlevoice_chr016_157,Wagner: Is that all you've got? How dull.
battlevoice_chr016_162,"Wagner: Hmph. This result is only natural, Orie Ballardiae."
battlevoice_chr016_164,"Wagner: Sorry, but I can't give my life up to you."
battlevoice_chr017_100,Enkidu: I'll test your strength.
battlevoice_chr017_101,Enkidu: ...Here I come.
battlevoice_chr017_102,Enkidu: ...A strong wind blows.
battlevoice_chr017_103,Enkidu: Now. Let us have a match.
battlevoice_chr017_104,Enkidu: Have you readied yourself?
battlevoice_chr017_105,Enkidu: I've been waiting anxiously for this!
battlevoice_chr017_106,Enkidu: The time has come.
battlevoice_chr017_110,"Enkidu: I challenge you, insatiable one!"
battlevoice_chr017_112,"Enkidu: Yes. I'm looking at them right now, in fact."
battlevoice_chr017_114,"Enkidu: I challenge you, dazzling darkness!"
battlevoice_chr017_116,Enkidu: It was all worth it for this moment.
battlevoice_chr017_119,"Enkidu: I challenge you, child of chaos!"
battlevoice_chr017_121,Enkidu: You should be able to show me the answer I seek.
battlevoice_chr017_123,Enkidu: None would find fault with you for losing to me as I am now.
battlevoice_chr017_140,Enkidu: Still too green.
battlevoice_chr017_141,Enkidu: This must be a joke.
battlevoice_chr017_142,Enkidu: Is that all?
battlevoice_chr017_143,Enkidu: Take this more seriously.
battlevoice_chr017_150,Enkidu: Interesting. As a battle should be.
battlevoice_chr017_151,Enkidu: You and I are both woefully inadequate.
battlevoice_chr017_152,Enkidu: I won't forget this bout.
battlevoice_chr017_154,Enkidu: This bout found only a razor's edge between us.
battlevoice_chr017_156,Enkidu: You're still too green. Try again later.
battlevoice_chr017_160,"Enkidu: I appreciate your help, but I can't hold back in a match."
battlevoice_chr018_100,Londrekia: This is another part of my duties.
battlevoice_chr018_102,Londrekia: In-Births must be kept under control.
battlevoice_chr018_103,Londrekia: A formidable looking opponent... but I'll prevail.
battlevoice_chr018_104,"Londrekia: By the name of Ritter Schild, I will not lose!"
battlevoice_chr018_105,Londrekia: There's nothing in all creation that cannot be frozen.
battlevoice_chr018_106,"Londrekia: A fair and honest match, with honor on the line for both of us."
battlevoice_chr018_107,"Londrekia: Regardless of your abilities, you will be frozen."
battlevoice_chr018_110,Londrekia: It's an honor to meet you.
battlevoice_chr018_111,Londrekia: I request a duel!
battlevoice_chr018_113,Londrekia: It seems our fates are deeply linked.
battlevoice_chr018_114,Londrekia: To think I'd encounter you again!
battlevoice_chr018_116,"Londrekia: I suppose this is the end of our relationship, then."
battlevoice_chr018_118,Londrekia: The... The Tenth Executor?!
battlevoice_chr018_121,Londrekia: I'll show you that even blazing flames can freeze!
battlevoice_chr018_122,"Londrekia: Face me, Void Hunter!"
battlevoice_chr018_123,Londrekia: I shall defeat you and prove the superiority of Ritter Schild!
battlevoice_chr018_140,Londrekia: Surely that's not all you've got.
battlevoice_chr018_141,Londrekia: Please don't get back up.
battlevoice_chr018_142,Londrekia: Do you still refuse to stand down?
battlevoice_chr018_143,Londrekia: You don't know when to give up.
battlevoice_chr018_144,Londrekia: Let's build this up little by little.
battlevoice_chr018_151,Londrekia: Thank you. That was a valuable experience.
battlevoice_chr018_152,"Londrekia: Quite the good match, if I may say so."
battlevoice_chr018_153,Londrekia: Mission complete.
battlevoice_chr018_154,"Londrekia: I would've liked to solve this peacefully, you know."
battlevoice_chr018_156,Londrekia: Still not enough training.
battlevoice_chr018_158,Londrekia: I hope you've learned at last to stay out of the Night.
battlevoice_chr018_161,"Londrekia: Well? Ritter Schild is also quite capable, wouldn't you say?"
battlevoice_chr018_163,"Londrekia: A regrettable ending, but perhaps there's no choice..."
battlevoice_chr018_165,Londrekia: Should I contact Licht Kreis about this child?
battlevoice_chr018_167,"Londrekia: You understand now, don't you?"
battlevoice_chr018_168,Londrekia: You aren't the only ace in this hole.
battlevoice_chr019_100,Tsurugi: All right! Here goes!
battlevoice_chr019_101,Tsurugi: C'mon! Let's fight!
battlevoice_chr019_102,"Tsurugi: Awright, let's hook this rookie up with some hard training!"
battlevoice_chr019_103,"Tsurugi: Blockin' my way, huh? Guess I've got no choice but to knock you out!"
battlevoice_chr019_107,Tsurugi: This is a perfect chance! Strut your stuff for me.
battlevoice_chr019_110,Tsurugi: I guess we're bound by the red string of fate!
battlevoice_chr019_113,Tsurugi: Speed and range... Can I even get close?
battlevoice_chr019_124,Tsurugi: All right! That's a win!
battlevoice_chr019_125,Tsurugi: Heh heh! I'm not gonna lose a fist fight!
battlevoice_chr019_126,Tsurugi: Hold up! You're getting way too careless!
battlevoice_chr019_129,Tsurugi: Awright! Score one for justice!
battlevoice_chr019_130,Tsurugi: Y'know what they say: there's no defense like a good offense!
battlevoice_chr019_131,Tsurugi: How 'bout that? Did my fists get the message across?
battlevoice_chr019_132,Tsurugi: Thanks. That was a good match.
battlevoice_chr019_135,Tsurugi: Nice fight! Let's do this again sometime!
battlevoice_chr019_138,Tsurugi: Sometimes a match just comes down to luck. These things happen.
battlevoice_chr019_142,"Tsurugi: That was a heated fight! I won't lose the next one, either!"
battlevoice_chr020_100,"Uzuki: Stay outta my way, or I'll erase you!"
battlevoice_chr020_101,Uzuki: Your EXS looks sooo yummy!
battlevoice_chr020_102,Uzuki: How 'bout I give you an up close and personal tour of Hell?
battlevoice_chr020_103,Uzuki: Don't think you can oppose me and get away unscathed!
battlevoice_chr020_108,"Uzuki: Uh, rude much? We're only friends!"
battlevoice_chr020_111,Uzuki: Hee hee hee! Lemme free your soul from that vessel for you!
battlevoice_chr020_114,Uzuki: Then I hope you're ready to scream your head off!
battlevoice_chr020_117,Uzuki: Don'tcha see? We were fated to end up this way.
battlevoice_chr020_120,Uzuki: Pfft! As if anybody'd find fault with me anyway!
battlevoice_chr020_123,"Uzuki: Secrets... Conspiracies... I don't mind 'em, y'know."
battlevoice_chr020_135,Uzuki: Get up. Playing dead won't work on me.
battlevoice_chr020_136,Uzuki: Ha! How pathetic!
battlevoice_chr020_137,Uzuki: You're done already? Boooring.
battlevoice_chr020_140,Uzuki: Kee hee hee hee hee! I'll be taking that EXS!
battlevoice_chr020_141,Uzuki: Hyaa ha ha! Written your death poem yet?
battlevoice_chr020_142,Uzuki: Lessee here... How to cook you...
battlevoice_chr020_143,Uzuki: You really don't live up to all the talk.
battlevoice_chr020_146,Uzuki: Eee hee hee hee! You sure made me work for this.
battlevoice_chr020_149,Uzuki: How'd you survive this long with skills that sorry?
battlevoice_chr020_154,"Uzuki: Aw, what's the matter? Had enough, Paradox?"
battlevoice_chr021_100,Mika: Heyyya!
battlevoice_chr021_101,Mika: Ta-dah! Mika's here!
battlevoice_chr021_102,Mika: I'll be your opponent!
battlevoice_chr021_103,"Mika: It's me, Mika! Let's do this!"
battlevoice_chr021_104,"Mika: Just lemme squeeze by, 'kay?"
battlevoice_chr021_106,Mika: Whoopsie! Get ready!
battlevoice_chr021_109,Mika: Bwah! Here comes a challenge!
battlevoice_chr021_112,Mika: Ouch! Time for your just deserts!
battlevoice_chr021_120,Mika: Heh! I'm not letting you come outta this looking cool!
battlevoice_chr021_121,Mika: Sounds good! We both speak fluent fist!
battlevoice_chr021_122,Mika: I'm gonna win this one!
battlevoice_chr021_140,Mika: Full speed ahead!
battlevoice_chr021_141,Mika: V for victory!
battlevoice_chr021_142,Mika: That settles that!
battlevoice_chr021_143,Mika: Woohoo! I won!
battlevoice_chr021_144,Mika: All right! Next! Next!
battlevoice_chr021_150,"Mika: I did it, I did it!"
battlevoice_chr021_151,Mika: Ow...
battlevoice_chr021_152,Mika: That hurt...
battlevoice_chr021_153,Mika: Wah ha ha ha ha!
battlevoice_chr021_154,Mika: Huh?
battlevoice_chr021_155,Mika: Urk...
battlevoice_chr021_158,"Mika: Big, biiig wiiiiiin!"
battlevoice_chr021_159,Mika: Oh?
battlevoice_chr021_160,"Mika: Aw, why?"
battlevoice_chr021_164,Mika: No match for me!
battlevoice_chr021_165,Mika: Huh?
battlevoice_chr021_166,Mika: Gyaaah!
battlevoice_chr021_170,"Mika: Aw, yeah! I beat Orie!"
battlevoice_chr021_171,Mika: Huh?
battlevoice_chr021_172,Mika: Talk about cruel and unusual punishment...
battlevoice_chr021_174,Mika: I'm not gonna lose to the rear guard!
battlevoice_chr021_176,Mika: Curses come home to roost...
battlevoice_chr022_100,Kaguya: I'll rout you magnificently!
battlevoice_chr022_101,Kaguya: Here I come! Get ready for a challenge!
battlevoice_chr022_102,Kaguya: You know what? I'll take you head-on!
battlevoice_chr022_103,"Kaguya: Oh, dear! Do you need punishment?"
battlevoice_chr022_104,Kaguya: Let's see what you have to offer.
battlevoice_chr022_105,Kaguya: The job will only get dirtier from here on out. Just leave it to me.
battlevoice_chr022_106,Kaguya: I'll wipe THAT smile off YOUR face.
battlevoice_chr022_107,Kaguya: ...Stop copying me.
battlevoice_chr022_108,Kaguya: Don't worry about it! I don't mind!
battlevoice_chr022_109,"Kaguya: Oh? Don't jinx yourself, or you'll regret it."
battlevoice_chr022_110,Kaguya: Do you have any final words?
battlevoice_chr022_130,Kaguya: An excellent showing.
battlevoice_chr022_131,Kaguya: There. Consider yourself punished!
battlevoice_chr022_132,Kaguya: How did my bullets taste?
battlevoice_chr022_140,"Kaguya: Oh, dear. Had enough already?"
battlevoice_chr022_141,"Kaguya: Okay, that's enough. Now sit right there and think about what you did."
battlevoice_chr022_142,Kaguya: You'll catch a cold if you fall asleep down there!
battlevoice_chr022_143,Kaguya: Hmm... Your mischief went a little too far.
battlevoice_chr022_144,Kaguya: Phew! That was dangerous.
battlevoice_chr022_145,"Kaguya: Oh, dear. I may have overdone it a bit..."
battlevoice_chr022_146,Kaguya: Hmm... I don't think I can leave Orie to you just yet.
battlevoice_chr023_100,Kuon: I shall pluck the fruit of your life.
battlevoice_chr023_101,"Kuon: Let us begin. The final Night, that is."
battlevoice_chr023_102,Kuon: Learn firsthand the meaning of my power.
battlevoice_chr023_103,"Kuon: As you wish, I'll face you with my full strength."
battlevoice_chr023_108,Kuon: As have I. And now all the players are assembled.
battlevoice_chr023_110,Kuon: ...An eternal tale needs no curtain call.
battlevoice_chr023_112,"Kuon: Ah... Sorry to keep you waiting for so long, my friend."
battlevoice_chr023_114,"Kuon: Oh, you're a scary one. But I'd rather you didn't make light of me."
battlevoice_chr023_117,Kuon: Do you really think you can?
battlevoice_chr023_119,Kuon: How many times must we repeat this?
battlevoice_chr023_121,Kuon: Are you sure you've got enough stomach for it?
battlevoice_chr023_124,"Kuon: You did me quite a service back then, heavenly messenger."
battlevoice_chr023_126,"Kuon: Stagnation is death. To live is to change, is it not?"
battlevoice_chr023_128,"Kuon: If you seek eternity, get accustomed to waiting."
battlevoice_chr023_130,Kuon: Of course. I accept it all.
battlevoice_chr023_132,Kuon: None. I have no need for your concern.
battlevoice_chr023_135,Kuon: Bold of you to step into this realm with a mere human body.
battlevoice_chr023_137,Kuon: I'll endeavor to entertain you.
battlevoice_chr023_160,"Kuon: You haven't given up yet, have you?"
battlevoice_chr023_161,Kuon: You're a bit beneath my expectations.
battlevoice_chr023_162,Kuon: Good grief. I overestimated you.
battlevoice_chr023_163,Kuon: I'd hoped you would show me more of your power.
battlevoice_chr023_171,Kuon: I shall surpass you and forge ahead.
battlevoice_chr023_172,"Kuon: Your skills are impressive. However, they're not impressive enough to touch mine."
battlevoice_chr023_173,"Kuon: Ah, I'm brimming with power..."
battlevoice_chr023_174,Kuon: Soon everything will end...
battlevoice_chr023_177,Kuon: I'm surprised. I didn't think you'd manage to push me this far.
battlevoice_chr023_181,Kuon: Do you understand the overwhelming difference in our power?
battlevoice_chr023_186,"Kuon: Now, then. Return your power to me."
battlevoice_chr023_188,"Kuon: At last, the time has come for this power to become whole."
battlevoice_chr024_100,Phonon: Did you seriously think you'd slip by me?
battlevoice_chr024_101,Phonon: You're up against the great Phonon. Prepare yourself.
battlevoice_chr024_102,"Phonon: ...Sheesh, you're annoying."
battlevoice_chr024_103,"Phonon: C'mon, Muni. Let's go."
battlevoice_chr024_105,Phonon: I... I'll make a flower of blood bloom!
battlevoice_chr024_106,Phonon: This is a real pain... but I'm out of options.
battlevoice_chr024_111,"Phonon: Watch what you say, will you...?"
battlevoice_chr024_113,"Phonon: Ugh, talk about sweaty. Just don't cry when you lose."
battlevoice_chr024_131,"Phonon: You can still keep going, right?"
battlevoice_chr024_132,"Phonon: You're not a very big deal, huh?"
battlevoice_chr024_133,Phonon: Okay! Feeling good!
battlevoice_chr024_138,Phonon: I'll give you a few more welts to remember me by...
battlevoice_chr024_140,Phonon: Hmph. Small fry.
battlevoice_chr024_141,Phonon: Don't you forget my name!
battlevoice_chr024_142,Phonon: You're all show.
battlevoice_chr024_145,Phonon: Ha ha! That was close.
battlevoice_chr024_149,Phonon: Thanks for wimping out on me.
battlevoice_chr024_154,"Phonon: Maybe I should finish you off, just in case..."
battlevoice_chr024_156,Phonon: Yeah! Did you see my skills?!
battlevoice_chr027_100,"Hyde: C'mon out, Insulator!"
battlevoice_chr027_101,Hyde: If you're gonna get in my way... I'll just mop you up!
battlevoice_chr027_102,Hyde: ...My power'll finish the job!
battlevoice_chr027_103,Hyde: Lemme show you... my power!
battlevoice_chr027_108,"Hyde: I'm not gonna be the same old Hyde forever, y'know."
battlevoice_chr027_111,Hyde: Sure have. And I've got you to thank for it.
battlevoice_chr027_113,Hyde: H-Hey! Don't say stuff that people might get twisted!
battlevoice_chr027_115,"Hyde: Welp, I guess we gotta settle things, anyway."
battlevoice_chr027_118,Hyde: Yet another bastard who never learns...
battlevoice_chr027_121,Hyde: What can I say? I'm a rebel. Nothing personal.
battlevoice_chr027_124,"Hyde: All right, time to drop the curtain!"
battlevoice_chr027_127,"Hyde: Tch. Can't believe I'm stuck with you, apparently."
battlevoice_chr027_130,"Hyde: ...Can't you just play nice and back down, already?"
battlevoice_chr027_133,Hyde: I didn't wanna fight you.
battlevoice_chr027_136,Hyde: You just might be the hardest one to deal with of all...
battlevoice_chr027_138,Hyde: Yeesh. Y'know what the scariest thing about you is? You almost look human.
battlevoice_chr027_151,Hyde: The wind's... pretty rough...
battlevoice_chr027_152,"Hyde: What...? All show and no substance, huh?"
battlevoice_chr027_155,Hyde: Just take a nap there.
battlevoice_chr027_156,Hyde: I guess this means I've grown.
battlevoice_chr027_157,Hyde: This is... my power...
battlevoice_chr027_160,Hyde: Th-That was a close one...
battlevoice_chr027_164,Hyde: Y'know... That wasn't as big a deal as I thought.
battlevoice_chr027_169,Hyde: See how I've grown? Leave the rest to me.
battlevoice_chr027_171,"Hyde: Sorry, Harada! I'll make it up to you sometime!"
battlevoice_chr028_100,Edmond Dantes: What do you see when you look at me?!,
battlevoice_chr028_101,Edmond Dantes: There's no end to the hells found in this world!,
battlevoice_chr028_102,Edmond Dantes: I am the Avenger Edmond Dantes. King of the Cavern!
battlevoice_chr028_103,Edmond Dantes: You aren't the one I'm looking for...,
battlevoice_chr028_104,Edmond Dantes: It seems this will get through to you faster than just talking.,
battlevoice_chr028_105,Edmond Dantes: Ahahahahahahahaha!,
battlevoice_chr028_110,Edmond Dantes: A vampire?! Come at me!,
battlevoice_chr028_111,Edmond Dantes: "We're cut from the same cloth, you and I!",
battlevoice_chr028_112,Edmond Dantes: "It's just what it sounds like, a little extra. Don't worry about it.",
battlevoice_chr028_113,Edmond Dantes: This time...you have some self-respect.,
battlevoice_chr028_114,Edmond Dantes: Have you forgotten that rage inside you?,
battlevoice_chr028_115,Edmond Dantes: "A snake is a snake in any world, it seems.",
battlevoice_chr028_116,Edmond Dantes: Same to you. You don't look like a theologian.,
battlevoice_chr028_117,Edmond Dantes: Impossible! There are no love or hate readings...at all?!,
battlevoice_chr028_118,Edmond Dantes: Now...,
battlevoice_chr028_125,Edmond Dantes: You deserve to burn. Now get up.,
battlevoice_chr028_126,Edmond Dantes: Show your true self!,
battlevoice_chr028_127,Edmond Dantes: Time for a smoke break.,
battlevoice_chr028_128,Edmond Dantes: Doesn't anyone have any coffee?,
battlevoice_chr028_130,Edmond Dantes: Pathetic. Collapsing won't earn you mercy.,
battlevoice_chr028_131,Edmond Dantes: I won't pity you. Wither away and die.,
battlevoice_chr028_132,Edmond Dantes: "Hmph. I get to relax a little now, at least.",
battlevoice_chr028_133,Edmond Dantes: Sleep...must be nice.,
battlevoice_chr028_134,Edmond Dantes: You've done it now. I can see that same old hell again.,
battlevoice_chr028_135,Edmond Dantes: Ha... Haha... Hahahahaha!,
battlevoice_chr028_136,Edmond Dantes: "Wallow in despair, the true hell!",
battlevoice_chr028_137,Edmond Dantes: May my flames of vengeance consume everything!,
